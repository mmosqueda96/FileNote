# FileNote
This File Note HTML is intended to facilate the process of writting a note to copy and paste.

The file should be able to allow users to fill textboxes with the notes
When texboes are completed. Users should be able to click a "Compile Note Botton" that will compile the note.
When note is compiled, users should be able to copy the note to their clipboard copying the format.


#Current Status
As for today. The document allows user to type their notes. If a box is empty, an pop-up screen wll shows a message asking to complete the missing fields.

#Current problem
Aftr teh form is complete, users can click the "Compile File Note" for it to compile the note and take it to anotehr page where users can copy the note and paste it on the desire destination.
The Compile File note does not compile the note, it just restarts the webpage.

#Posible solutions:
write anotehr scrip that will comple the file note
